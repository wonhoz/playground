## What is this?

This is my **digital sandbox** - a collection of projects that started as "what if..." moments and evolved into actual working tools that I use every day.

Some call it a playground. I call it **organized chaos with version control**.

## Projects

### Photo & Video Organizer
*Because life's too short to manually sort 3,847 photos from your phone.*

A sleek WPF application that takes the chaos of phone backups and transforms them into beautifully organized folders by date. Drag, drop, done.

- Extracts dates from EXIF, QuickTime metadata, or filename patterns
- Creates `yyyy/MM/` folder structure automatically
- Renames files to `yyyy-MM-dd HH.mm.ss` format
- Dark theme UI that doesn't burn your eyes at 2 AM

### Slack Stay Awake
*For when "I'm totally still here" needs to be automated.*

A system tray app that keeps your Slack status green while you're... focusing intensely on other things. Uses sophisticated mouse movement simulation technology (it moves your mouse randomly).

## Philosophy

```csharp
while (alive)
{
    var idea = Brain.GetRandomThought();

    if (idea.Sounds("interesting") || idea.Sounds("useful"))
    {
        Playground.Add(idea.Implement());
        Coffee.Consume();
    }
}
```

I believe in:
- **Building tools I actually use** - No theoretical projects here
- **Dark mode everything** - My retinas thank me
- **Clean code over clever code** - Future me should understand present me
- **Shipping over perfecting** - Done is better than perfect
